File name: BioMed_Asgn1_1a.py is containing code for problem 1

	1. After running the code, the code will ask to "Enter the pole radius (0.8 - 0.95): ", Enter any number between 0.8 to 0.95 
	2. First the plot of pure ecg signal will be displayed 
	3. Then ecg with noise will be displayed
	4. Then Filtered Output only with notch filter will be displayed
	5. Then plot showing comaprison between noisy and filtered signal will be displayed
	6. Then, Filtered output with transfer function with poles and zeroes will be displayed
	7. Then plot showing comaprison between noisy and filtered signal will be displayed
	8. Then plot showing comaprison between filtered signal from both type of transfer function will be displayed


File name: BioMed_Asgn1_2.py is containing code for problem 2
	1. SNR of input signal (before filtering) will be displayed 
	2. Then, Improvemnet with fc =  30  and n=  6  and SDR will be displayed 
	3. Then, Improvemnet with fc =  40  and n=  6  and SDR will be displayed
	4. Then, Improvemnet with fc =  50  and n=  8  and SDR will be displayed
	5. Then, Improvemnet with fc =  70  and n=  8  and SDR will be displayed


File name: BioMed_Assgn3_a.py is containing code for problem 3
	1. The three point central difference operator filtered signal in green and input signal in blue will be displayd 
	2. Then the butterworth filter Order 3 , cutoff frequency 3Hz output is displyed
	3. Then the butterworth filter Order 5 , cutoff frequency 5Hz output is displyed
	4. Then the butterworth filter Order 8 , cutoff frequency 8Hz output is displyed
